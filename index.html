    <p> HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

        HTTP1.1 will take lot of time to load but HTTP2 loads very fast.
        Multiplexing: HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it.
        In contrast, HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource. 
        HTTP/2 does this by splitting data into binary-code messages and numbering these messages so that the client knows which stream each binary message belongs to.
        
        Server push: Typically, a server only serves content to a client device if the client asks for it. However, this approach is not always practical for modern webpages, which often involve several dozen separate resources that the client must request.
         HTTP/2 solves this problem by allowing a server to "push" content to a client before the client asks for it.
         The server also sends a message letting the client know what pushed content to expect – like if Bob had sent Alice a Table of Contents of his novel before sending the whole thing.
        
         Header compression: Small files load more quickly than large ones. To speed up web performance, both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 compress HTTP messages to make them smaller. 
         However, HTTP/2 uses a more advanced compression method called HPACK that eliminates redundant information in HTTP header packets.
         This eliminates a few bytes from every HTTP packet. 
         Given the volume of HTTP packets involved in loading even a single webpage, those bytes add up quickly, resulting in faster loading.</p>

         <p>Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

            A JavaScript object has properties associated with it. A property of an object can be explained as a variable that is attached to the object. 
            Object properties are basically the same as ordinary JavaScript variables, except for the attachment to objects.
             The properties of an object define the characteristics of the object.
            
             Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.
            An object, is a reference data type. Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value. 
            That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored. The variables don’t actually store the value.
            
             objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. 
             These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.</p>
